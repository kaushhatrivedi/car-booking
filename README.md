his single page web application shows the implementation of Dijkstraâ€™s Algorithm for finding the  shortest path between 2 vertices in a graph. Here, we have created a map using graph and made the  visualization easy using HTML Canvas element. The user can select a source vertex and a destination  vertex, and can trace the shortest/fastest path.
